This project is **currently** being developed and improved with additional features and testing.

# AI Research Assistant

**AI Research Assistant** is a production-style code Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that lets users query one or more research papers in natural language. The assistant uses a free Hugging Face-hosted large language model (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) and FAISS-powered semantic search to generate answers grounded in the content of uploaded PDFs.

## Limitations

AI Research Assistant works well for textual data and not optimized for images and tabular forms of data.
