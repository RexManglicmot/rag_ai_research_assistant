This project is **currently** being developed and improved with additional features and testing.

## Inspiration

During my undergrad and grad studies, we were given enormous stacks of papers to read. A bit too much. A fellow grad student of mine told me that is impossible to read everything and recommended to skim for main points, which I ultimately did. Although this skill was useful back then, I wish there was a tool that would allow synthesize main findings. Thus, the inspiration for this particular project. 

# AI Research Assistant

This project is meant to be a **production-style code** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that lets users query one or more research papers in natural language. The assistant uses a free Hugging Face-hosted large language model (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) and FAISS-powered semantic search to generate answers grounded in the content of uploaded PDFs.

## Limitations
AI Research Assistant works well for textual data and not optimized for images and tabular forms of data.
